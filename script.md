# From Corporate Coder to AI Tinkerer: Building My Second Brain

**(Intro Music with on-screen title: Corporate Kid Tries to Build a Second Brain)**

**You (to camera):**

So, I'm what you might call a "classically trained" corporate software engineer. I went to a great school, got a degree in Computer Engineering, and for the last few years, I've been writing Java code for a Fortune 500 company.

And honestly? I'm bored.

The pay is great, I have the job I always thought I wanted, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm stuck in first gear. I see what's happening on the cutting edge of software, and I want in.

This is my attempt to break out of the corporate bubble, to get my hands dirty with the tech that's shaping our future, and to document the entire journey.

## Meet Jarvis: More Than a Chatbot

**You (Voice-over with screen recording of the app):**

This is Jarvis. It's an open-source project I forked, and it's my playground for exploring the world of AI.

The vision is simple: an AI assistant that's more than just a text-in, text-out chatbot. Jarvis is designed to listen to your conversations, see what you're seeing on your screen, and provide real-time insights. Think of it as a digital extension of your own mind.

And for all you privacy advocates out there, you can run it completely locally with your own models. This is all about exploration.

## How I'm Building This (with a little help from my AI friend)

**You (to camera):**

Now, I'm not just building an AI app, I'm building it *with* AI.

I've been using the Gemini CLI to help me navigate this project. I jumped into a pretty complex codebase without much prior experience in this stack. Gemini has been my guide, helping me understand the architecture, stripping down the parts I don't need, and even refactoring the code.

It helped me fix conversation history, redesign the prompt flow, and even rebuild the web UI.

Let me show you how it works.

**(DEMO - 1-2 minutes)**

*   Show a basic flow of the app running.
*   Talk through a simple "ask" and "guide" interaction.
*   Briefly show the code and explain the `ask`, `listen`, `stt`, and `summary` services.

## What's Next?

**You (to camera):**

So that's a quick look at Jarvis and how I'm building it. But this is just the beginning.

My next step is to really start *using* the app day-to-day to figure out what's useful and what's not. I want to move beyond the "cheating on interviews" framing and explore how this can be a legitimate tool for thought.

I'll be dialing in the UI, implementing a real-time interactive dashboard, and maybe even giving it a bit of an "Iron Man" aesthetic (but tasteful, of course).

And I'm going to be documenting everything, right here on this channel. We'll dive deep into the code, I'll show you how I'm using Gemini and other AI tools in my workflow, and we'll see if we can't build something truly special.

## Join the Journey

**You (to camera):**

My goal here is to get better at articulating my technical thoughts, and to connect with other people who are excited about this stuff.

If you want to follow along, subscribe to the channel and follow me on X at @TangLLC. And if you're a developer, the project is open source. I'd love for you to check it out.

Thanks for watching. Now, let's get back to building.
