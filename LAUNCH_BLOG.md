# From Corporate Coder to AI Tinkerer: Building My Second Brain

I've spent the first few years of my career as a corporate software engineer. I studied Computer Engineering at a top university, and I landed a stable, well-paying job at a Fortune 500 company writing Java SpringBoot APIs. It's the career I always thought I wanted.

But lately, I've been feeling restless. The work is slow-moving, and I've found myself maintaining a Postgres database of emails, a task that feels worlds away from the exciting developments I see happening in the tech world every day on platforms like X and YouTube.

I realized I was bottlenecked by bureaucracy, and I wanted more. So, I decided to start a new journey: to get my hands dirty with cutting-edge AI and build something of my own.

## Introducing Jarvis: An AI-Powered Second Brain

This is where Jarvis comes in. Jarvis is an open-source AI assistant that I forked, and it's become my personal laboratory for experimenting with the latest in artificial intelligence. The goal is to create an assistant that goes beyond a simple chatbot. Jarvis is designed to listen to your audio, take screenshots, and provide you with insights in real time—a true extension of your own mind.

## Building with AI: My Experience with Gemini

I'm not just building an AI application; I'm building it *with* AI. I've been using the Gemini CLI to help me get up to speed on the project. I came into a large and unfamiliar codebase, but Gemini has been instrumental in helping me understand the general flow and structure of the application.

With Gemini's help, I've:

*   Stripped down the application to its essential features.
*   Resolved issues with conversation history.
*   Created a new "ask/guide" workflow in place of the old "summary/follow-up" model.
*   Rebuilt the prompt flow to operate in real time.
*   Redesigned the web UI.

## The Future of Jarvis

Now that the foundation is in place, the real work begins. I need to start using the application in my daily life to determine what features are truly useful and where to take the project next. My vision is to create a tool that is seen as an acceptable and valuable "digital mind extension," rather than something that needs to be hidden.

Some of my immediate goals include:

*   **Improving the UI:** I plan to transform the conversation history into a live, interactive dashboard that includes transcription, summary, ask, and guide functionality.
*   **Implementing Search:** The search feature doesn't work yet, and I want to implement it to allow users to find the most relevant moments in their conversation history, making this a functional place to take notes as well - not a tool just to record moments and then move insights to Notion. Live in Jarvis.
*   **Adding a Touch of Style:** I'm thinking of giving the UI an "Iron Man" inspired look—clean, classy, and futuristic.

## Join Me on This Journey

I'm documenting this entire process as a way to practice articulating my technical thoughts and to connect with others who are passionate about the future of AI. If you'd like to follow along, you can find me on X at @TangLLC.

And if you're a developer, I invite you to check out the source code. It's all open source, and I'm always open to collaboration.

This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. Let's build the future together.
